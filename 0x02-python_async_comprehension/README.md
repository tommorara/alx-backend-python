# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## üìö Description

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python, specifically focusing on **asynchronous comprehensions** and **generators**. Through a series of tasks, you will gain hands-on experience using `async` and `await`, and learn how to run asynchronous code concurrently using `asyncio`.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Write asynchronous generators in Python.
- Use asynchronous comprehensions.
- Annotate generator functions with type hints.
- Understand the runtime behavior of parallel asynchronous operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Python version:** Python 3.7 (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- **Style:** Code must follow `pycodestyle` (v2.5.x)
- All Python files must:
  - Have `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as the first line.
  - End with a new line.
  - Include **module and function-level docstrings** as complete sentences.
  - Include **type annotations** for all functions and coroutines.
- A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project folder.
