# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## 📚 Description

This project is part of the **ALX Backend Python** specialization and focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python. The objective is to understand the difference between unit and integration tests, utilize tools like `unittest`, `mock`, and `parameterized`, and practice best practices in testing code functionality with and without side effects (like HTTP and database calls).
